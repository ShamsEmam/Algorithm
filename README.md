## 📚 Algorithms

### 🔍 Search Algorithms:
- **Binary Search**: A fast searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the value is found or the interval is empty.
- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks each element in the array sequentially until the target value is found.

### 🔄 Sorting Algorithms:
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting each new element into the correct position.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
